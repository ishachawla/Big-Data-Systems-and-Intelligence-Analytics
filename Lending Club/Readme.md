# Lending Club Loan Prediction Algorithm Analysis

**Lending club is a P-P platform that provides a platform between Lenders and Borrowers. A lot of organizations have seen a considerable increase in the loans that default.**

### Getting and Cleaning Files

This IPython notebook contains the information on how to download the files from Lending Club and loading them to a dataframe in Python.

### Decision Tree and Ensemble Methods
[Decision Tree and Ensemble Methods](https://github.com/ishachawla/Big-Data-Systems-and-Intelligence-Analytics/blob/master/Lending%20Club/Lending%20Club-%20Decision%20Tree-%20Ensemble%20Methods.ipynb)

Decision Tree is one of the most commonly used algorithm for classification problems and I have tried to use decision trees, random forest and XGBoost with paramater and hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV and RandomSearchCV.

### Multi Layer Perceptron for classification

We use Keras to make models that can efficiently used for Binary Classification, we try different parameters and hyperparameters to get an accurate model.
